 This code is based on code written by Patrick Powell <papowell@astart.com>.
 It may be used for any purpose as long as this notice remains intact on all
 source code distributions.
 .
 This version of the code is maintained by Holger Weiss <holger@jhweiss.de>.
 My changes to the code may freely be used, modified and/or redistributed for
 any purpose. It would be nice if additions and fixes to this file (including
 trivial code cleanups) would be sent back in order to let me include them in
 the version available at <http://www.jhweiss.de/software/snprintf.html>.
 However, this is not a requirement for using or redistributing (possibly
 modified) versions of this file, nor is leaving this notice intact mandatory.
