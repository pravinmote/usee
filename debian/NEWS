ccache (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The way the hashes are calculated has changed, so you won't get cache hits
  for compilation results stored by older ccache versions. Because of this,
  you might as well clear the old cache directory with `ccache --clear` if you
  want, unless you plan to keep using an older ccache version.

  zlib compression has now been incorporated upstream, but it's off by
  default. To enable compression, set the CCACHE_COMPRESS environment
  variable.

  See /usr/share/doc/ccache/changelog.gz for more upstream release notes for
  3.0 as well as 3.0.1.

ccache (2.4-8) unstable; urgency=high

  zlib compression is now enabled by default in order to increase the amount
  of object files that can fit in the cache.

  The impact on performance is supposed to be almost negligible
  (see http://www.gustaebel.de/lars/ccache/). If you do want to disable
  it however, simply export the CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS environment variable.

  Note that a zlib-enabled ccache will still read your existing
  uncompressed cache.  If you want to compress/uncompress your cache,
  see the manage-cache.sh script under /usr/share/doc/ccache/examples/.

ccache (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release changes the hash input slighly, so you will probably find
    that you will not get any hits against your existing cache when you
    upgrade.
