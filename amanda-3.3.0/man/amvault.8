.SH "WARNING"
.PP
This application is not yet in its final form, and is subject to major revision in subsequent versions of Amanda\&. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed\&.
.PP
Note that Amanda restore/recover operations will request tertiary media by label when dumpfiles are not found on secondary media, but there is no provision to automatically fetch such media from a different changer
.PP
Feedback on and patches to this application are invited and encouraged!
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Amvault is conceptually equivalent to "amfetchdump | taper"\&. That is, it reads specified dumps from secondary media and re\-writes them on tertiary media\&.
.PP
\fBAmvault\fR
Copies data from the run with timestamp
\fBsrc\-timestamp\fR
onto volumes using the changer
\fBdst\-changer\fR, and labeling new volumes with
\fBlabel\-template\fR\&. If
\fBsrc\-timestamp\fR
is "latest", then the most recent amdump or amflush run will be used\&. If
\fB\-\-fulls\-only\fR
is given, then only full (level\-0) dumps are copied\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
(\fB\-q\fR) option will eliminate non\-error messages, and is useful when running amvault from cron\&. The
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
(\fB\-n\fR) option will cause amvault to print the dumps it would vault, but not actually perform any vaulting operations\&.
.SS "Secondary Media"
.PP
The dumps to be read from secondary media can be specified by any combination of dump specifications,
\fB\-\-fulls\-only\fR, and
\fB\-\-src\-timestamp\fR\&. At least one must be specified, lest amvault attempt to vault all dumps in the catalog\&. See
\fBamanda-match\fR(7)
for more information on dump specifications\&.
.PP
Note that the datestamp given in the dumpspec is the
\fIdump\fR
datestamp \- the run in which the backup was taken on the Amanda client\&. The
\fB\-\-src\-timestamp\fR, on the other hand, is the
\fIwrite\fR
timestamp \- the run in which the dump was written to secondary media\&. The latter option facilitates duplicating the results of an entire backup run, including any dumps that might have been flushed from holding disk\&.
.SS "Tertiary Media"
.PP
The
\fB\-\-dst\-changer\fR
must be specified, and names the changer in which tertiary media are stored\&. In general, this should be different from the secondary changer, to eliminate the possibility of overwriting secondary media with tertiary data\&.
.PP
The changer parameter should specify the name of a changer defined in
\fBamanda.conf\fR(5)\&. For example:
.sp
.nf
define changer vaulting_tape {
    tapedev "/dev/rmt/1n"
    tpchanger "chg\-zd\-mtx"
    changerdev "/dev/sg0"
    changerfile "vaulting\-changer\&.conf"
}
.fi
.PP
The
\fB\-\-label\-template\fR
option is required, and specifies a label template which is used to generate new labels for tertiary volumes\&. The
\fB\-\-autolabel\fR
option works just like the
\fBautolabel\fR
parameter in
\fBamanda.conf\fR(5), and can be specified multiple times if necessary\&. The default is \'empty\'\&.
.PP
If
\fBamanda.conf\fR(5)
contains the new
\fBpart\-size\fR
splitting parameters, then amvault will use them without any additional configuration\&. However, if the configuration still uses the old splitting parameters (\fBtape_splitsize\fR,
\fBsplit_diskbuffer\fR, and
\fBfallback_splitsize\fR), then amvault will need some additional configuration in order to properly split dumps to tertiary media\&. To do so, specify a new tapetype in
\fBamanda.conf\fR(5), say "TERTIARY", and set the
\fBpart\-size\fR
and other appropriate parameters there\&. Then reference that tapetype in the amvault invocation:
.sp
.nf
    amvault \-otapetype=TERTIARY \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.PP
The
\fB\-\-export\fR
option will cause amvault to attempt to move completed tertiary volumes to import/export slots, where they can be more easily removed by an operator\&.
