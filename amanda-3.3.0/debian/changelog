  * make sure all build dependencies are present, closes: #67008
  * move canonical location of amandahosts file to /etc, moving existing file

amanda (1:2.4.1p1-12) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * revert amplot/Makefile.in to upstream version to dodge issues created 
    by newer automake version.  Note that items in the build depends
    list in the control file *must* be available or the package build will
    fail, as some executables won't be generated if configure doesn't find 
    everything it wants!  Closes: #64864, marked as grave for potato.

    dependencies are worth fixing for potato even though both were filed as
    "normal" bugs
  * add extra cases to amanda-client's filtering of tar output to eliminate
    user concern and confusion from spurious "FAILED DUMP" messages,

  * the amanda-server package depends on mailx because the upstream source
    looks for mailx at configure time, embeds the path, and uses it to send

  * have amanda-server suggest mailx, since amcheck optionally uses 
    /usr/bin/Mail to notify the operator of needed tapes, closes 18334
  * improve the postinst slightly... the home directory for user backup needs

  * incorporate amanda-common split suggested by Tom Lear's 2.4.0b4 package.
    this replaces 'amanda' with 'amanda-server', and breaks out an 
    'amanda-common' package to hold the libs and man pages that were formerly
    conflicting between amanda and amanda-client.  Closes bugs 11046, 11943.

  * make amanda and amanda-client depend on netbase (>=3.03) for /etc/services
    entries.  Remove /etc/services mashing from postinst.  Closes bugs 12847,
    12848, 13795.
  * make amanda depend on amanda-client.  This is the easiest way to resolve
    the overlapping files problem.  It makes the assumption that if you're
    running an amanda server, you'll want the client stuff anyway so you can 
    back up the server.  Since the client package is small, this seems like a
    better resolution than splitting out a third "common" package.  Closes
    bugs 11046, 11943.
  * update all references to /etc/amandates and /etc/dumpdates to use 
    /var/lib/*dates, ala current Debian dump package.  Closes bug 15586.
  * pre-apply all the patches from the upstream archive, to simplify the 
    build process.  Patches applied include: arithexc.diff,exclude2.diff,
    flushidx.diff,srvcomp.diff,tardates.diff,exclude.diff,exclude3.diff,
    longopt.diff, and srvcomp2.diff.  Closes bug 13151, 13796.
