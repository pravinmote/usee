Notes on making amanda-client work on a Debian system

To get indexing (or specifically amrecover) to work right two things need
to be done:

1. If you're using tcpd, make sure to edit the server's /etc/hosts.allow and 
   allow all client machines into the daemon amandad

2. Edit the server(s) ~backup/.amandahosts and add an entry like:
   "<client_hostname>   root"

As always: for more complex setups consult the manpages and available
documentation in /usr/share/doc/amanda-common ;-)
